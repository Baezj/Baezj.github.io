        <h2>8. Data and Privacy</h2>

        <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The App, including all content, features, and functionality, is owned by Magic Domino and is protected by international copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws. The Magic Domino™ name and logo are trademarks of Magic Domino.</p>

        <h2>10. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>We work hard to make Magic Domino reliable and bug-free, but like all software, we can't guarantee perfection. Here's the legal language we're required to include:</p>
        <p><strong>THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE APP WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.</strong></p>

        <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>We strive to provide a great experience, but we need to protect ourselves legally. Here's the standard liability limitation:</p>
        <p><strong>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL MAGIC DOMINO BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES RESULTING FROM:</strong></p>

While we strive to keep the App running smoothly, we cannot be held liable for any changes or service interruptions.</p>

        <h2>13. Termination</h2>
        <p>If you violate these Terms, we may stop providing updates, support, or access to Premium features. Since you download the App through the Apple App Store, Apple controls installation and removal - we don't have the ability to remotely disable the App on your device. However, we reserve the right to discontinue service or support if these Terms are violated.</p>

        <h2>14. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App integrates with third-party services including:</p>

If we make significant changes, we'll update the date at the top and notify you through the App or other appropriate means. Your continued use of the App after changes means you accept the updated Terms.</p>
